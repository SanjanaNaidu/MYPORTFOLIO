                I'm Sanjana Naidu Gedela, a dedicated and enthusiastic computer science professional with a strong passion for technology and data-driven solutions.
                <br />Currently pursuing a Master's in Computer Science at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, I have honed my skills in a wide range of programming <br/>languages and technologies, from Python and Java to SQL and web development tools.
                <br />My journey in the world of technology has been an exciting one, filled with valuable experiences and accomplishments. As a Software Engineer at DXC<br/> Technologies, I played a crucial role in database software development, migration, and management, contributing to performance optimization <br/>and incident automation. Additionally, as an Instructional Teaching Assistant, I had the privilege of assisting fellow students in understanding<br/>
                 complex concepts and supporting cutting-edge research in data mining.
                <br />My commitment to continuous learning has led to certifications in cloud computing and database management, further enriching my skill set.<br/>
                 I am a proud member of the Microsoft Women In Software Engineering (WISE) Program, where I've maximized my learning and research potential.
                <br />Driven by curiosity and a desire to make a positive impact, I look forward to new challenges and opportunities in the ever-evolving field of technology.
