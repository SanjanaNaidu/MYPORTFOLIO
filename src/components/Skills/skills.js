                I'm Sanjana Naidu Gedela, a dedicated and enthusiastic computer science professional with a strong passion for technology and data-driven solutions.
                Currently pursuing a Master's in Computer Science at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, I have honed my skills in a wide range of programming
                languages and technologies, from Python and Java to SQL and web development tools.
                My journey in the world of technology has been an exciting one, filled with valuable experiences and accomplishments. As a Software Engineer at DXC
                Technologies, I played a crucial role in database software development, migration, and management, contributing to performance optimization 
                and incident automation. Additionally, as an Instructional Teaching Assistant, I had the privilege of assisting fellow students in understanding
                complex concepts and supporting cutting-edge research in data mining.
                My commitment to continuous learning has led to certifications in cloud computing and database management, further enriching my skill set.
                I am a proud member of the Microsoft Women In Software Engineering (WISE) Program, where I've maximized my learning and research potential.
                Driven by curiosity and a desire to make a positive impact, I look forward to new challenges and opportunities in the ever-evolving field of technology.
